Upgrade the kernel to Newest Version (for me it is 5.4) With UKUU.

You should install Ubuntu Kernel Upgrade Utility (UKUU).

sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ukuu

Run UKUU with this command:

sudo ukuu-gtk

In the UKUU GUI select Kernel 5.4 and install it. When the process finishes, you have to reboot.

Reboot!

If after waking up, your Wifi is broken, you have to deal with wifi settings and connect to wifi.

Create new dir /etc/pm/config.d

sudo mkdir /etc/pm/config.d

Create a new file in this dir

sudo touch config

Edit this file

sudo -H gedit /etc/pm/config.d/config

SUSPEND_MODULES="iwlwifi"

Save, close and Reboot

Then the power button is working.
