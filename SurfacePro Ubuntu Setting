My device is Surface Pro 5
After installing Ubuntu system 18.04, the kernel vison is 5.0.*
The newest kernel version 5.4 is not working on some function ,for example, touchscreen, power button and power status.
So the kernel version of 5.3.18 for surface is reccommonded.

Update and Upgrade

sudo apt update & upgrade

Install packages

sudo apt install git

Clone this repository

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface.git

cd linux-surface (change to linux surface directory)

sudo ./setup.sh

Then you need download and install Kernel packages from https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/releases

sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-[VERSION].deb linux-image-[VERSION].deb linux-libc-dev-[VERSION].deb

As mentioned above, the kernel version of 5.3.18 is installed.

After installing kernel, reboot your device.

You can check the kernel version running on your device by uname -r

After rebooting, the kernel version should be "5.3.18-surface"

Then all functions is working well.
